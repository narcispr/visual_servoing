# Visual Servoing lab
This lab was created by Pere Ridao and Narc√≠s Palomeras by the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree MAIA in the University of Girona for the course about Medical Robots.

## Installation
The package has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic but it should work with other ROS flavours.
This package has 2 dependencies that have to be manually installed:
* [https://github.com/ros-industrial/kuka_experimental](https://github.com/ros-industrial/kuka_experimental]):To have the URDF for the kuka manipulator
* [https://github.com/lucasw/rviz_camera_stream](https://github.com/lucasw/rviz_camera_stream): To simulate a camera using only RViz

Clone the 3 packages in your `CATKIN_WORKSPACE` using `$ git clone ...`. Then check that everything is correctly 
installed. To do it execute:

```bash
$ roslaunch visual_servoing visual_servoing.launch
```

An RViz window similar to this one should appears.

If you want to move the arm manually be sure to enable the param
```xml
<param name="use_gui" value="true" />
```
in the file [./launch/visual_servoing.launch](./launch/visual_servoing.launch).

### Exercises
This package will be used to perform a couple of exercises that will be provided to you. 
Follow them to complete the lab.
